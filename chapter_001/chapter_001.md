#A 'Hello World' in 5 minutes

This chapters goals include:

* Installing Dylan
* Creating a "Hello World" project
* Compiling and running the project

##Installing OpenDylan

##Creating your first project

Dylan can auto-build a project for you using the "make-dylan-app" command.  Run the following command in the directory you keep all your dylan projects (for me that is /home/philipwoods/workspace):

```bash
make-dylan-app hello-world
```

##Compiling your project
